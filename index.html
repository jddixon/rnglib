<h1>rnglib</h1>

<p>A Python random number generator especially useful for generating
quasi-random strings, files, and directories.</p>

<p>This package contains three classes, SimpleRNG, SystemRNG,
and SecureRNG.  All of these subclass Python&rsquo;s &ldquo;random&rdquo; standard
library and so random&rsquo;s functions can be called through any
of rnglib&rsquo;s three subclasses.</p>

<p>SimpleRNG is the fastest of the subclasses.  It uses the Mersenne
Twister and so is completely predictable with a very long period.
It is suitable where speed and predictability are both important.
That is, you can be certain that if you provide the same seed, then
the sequence of numbers generated will be exactly the same.  This is
often important for debugging.</p>

<p>SystemRNG is a secure random number generator, meaning that it is
extremely difficult or impossible to predict the next number
generated in a sequence.  It is based on the system&rsquo;s /dev/urandom.
This relies in part upon entropy accumulated by the system; when
this is insufficient it will revert to using a very secure
programmable random number generator.</p>

<p>SecureRNG is a very secure random number generator based on
/dev/random.  This also relies upon entropy accumulated by the
system, but will block when there is not enough entropy available
to generate the random value requested.  This means that it can be
very slow.</p>

<p>For normal use in testing, SimpleRNG is preferred.  When there is
a requirement for a reasonable level of security, as in the
generation of passwords and cryptographic keys with reasonable
strength, SystemRNG is recommended.  Where there is a need for
very secure random values, use SecureRNG but expect to wait a
while for results.</p>

<p>In addition to the functions available from Python&rsquo;s random package,
rnglib also provides</p>

<pre><code>nextBoolean()
nextByte(max=256)
nextBytes(buffer)
nextInt16(max=65536])
nextInt32(max=65536*65536)
nextInt64(max=65536*65536*65536*65536)
nextReal()
nextFileName(maxLen)
nextDataFile(dirName, maxLen, minLen=0)
nextDataDir(pathToDir, depth, width, maxLen, minLen=0)
</code></pre>

<p>Given a buffer of arbitrary length, nextBytes() will fill it with random
bytes.</p>

<p>File names generated by nextFileName() are at least one character long.<br />
The first letter must be alphabetic (including the underscore)
whereas other characters may also be numeric or either of dot and dash
(&ldquo;.&rdquo; and &ldquo;-&rdquo;).</p>

<p>The function nextDataFile() creates a file with a random name in the
directory indicated.  The file length will vary from minLen (which
defaults to zero) up to but excluding maxLen bytes.</p>

<p>The nextDataDir() function creates a directory structure that is
&lsquo;depth&rsquo; deep and &lsquo;width&rsquo; wide, where the latter means that there
will be that many files in each directory and subdirectory created
(where is file is either a data file or a directory).  Depth and
width must both be at least 1.  maxLen and minLen are used as in
nextDataFile().</p>

<p>rnglib was implemented as part of the <a href="http://www.xlattice.org">XLattice</a>
project.  A Go language implementation forms part of
<a href="https://gibhub.com/jddixon/xlattice_go">xlattice_go</a>.</p>
